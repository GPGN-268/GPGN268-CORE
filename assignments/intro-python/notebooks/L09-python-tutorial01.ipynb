    "\n",
    "**Preface**:  It is not GPGN268's goal to teach you *all* of Python.  Learning the language in a semester is difficult enough, and we only have a couple weeks.  Instead, our goal is to teach you just enough Python so that you can apply the basics of it to geophysical data analysis.  We're going to skip over some *very* important coding concepts, such as classes and objects. These are certainly good things to know, and in the future you will need to learn them if you work in a geoscience job with a heavy emphasis on coding or Python. However, right now, said topics are not our priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is meant as a quick introduction to some fundamental Python concepts which you may or may not already know. You're encouraged to play with the code blocks and experiment.  Think of this notebook as something to keep on hand as a reference on core Python syntax.  There's also some links to where you can find more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have some coding experience, the majority of this notebook will be purely review.  \n",
