#### Activate the class environment
Navigate back to your  `ds02-seismology` directory and activate the class environment

``$ conda activate GPGN268``

`$ pip install obspy`     
`$ pip install seisbench`  
`$ pip install cartopy`  
`$ pip install pyocto`  

After this, you should be able to launch Jupyter Lab and run the notebook locally.
