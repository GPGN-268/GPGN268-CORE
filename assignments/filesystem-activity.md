### âœ… To do
 - Choose a directory on your computer that is at least three levels below your home. Make a sketch of your filesystem (either on paper or on a tablet). If you do it on paper, take a picture of it.
 - Open the terminal, and navigate to the directory that you chose. Then do the following:
	1. Run `pwd`
	2. Type `history` and hit return
	3. Take a screenshot of your terminal
- Rename your filesystem sketch and your terminal screenshot using expressive names and using a convention that follows best practices of file organization.
- Upload it to Canvas
