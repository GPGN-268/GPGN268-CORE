    "## What is netCDF Data?\n",
    "NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a hierarchical data format. It is what is known as a ‚Äúself-describing‚Äù data structure which means that metadata, or descriptions of the data, are included in the file itself and can be parsed programmatically, meaning that they can be accessed using code dto build automated and reproducible workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NetCDF format can store data with multiple dimensions. It can also store different types of data through arrays that can contain geospatial imagery, rasters, terrain data, climate data, and text. These arrays support metadata, making the netCDF format highly flexible. NetCDF was developed and is supported by [UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu/) who maintains standards and software that support the use of the format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data in netCDF format is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Self-Describing**. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains.\n",
    "- **Portable**. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\n",
    "- **Scalable**. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\n",
    "- **Appendable**. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\n",
    "- **Sharable**. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\n",
    "- **Archivable**. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "### NetCDF4 Format for Climate Data\n",
    "The hierarchical and flexible nature of netcdf files supports storing data in many different ways. The netCDF4 data standard is used broadly by the climate science community to store climate data. Climate data are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- often delivered in a time series format (months and years of historic or future projected data).\n",
    "- spatial in nature, covering regions such as the United States or even the world.\n",
    "- driven by models which require documentation making the self describing aspect of netCDF files useful.\n"

    "## Xarray for multidimensional gridded data\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous set of lectures, we saw how Pandas provided a way to keep track of additional ‚Äúmetadata‚Äù surrounding tabular datasets, including ‚Äúindexes‚Äù for each row and labels for each column. These features, together with Pandas‚Äô many useful routines for all kinds of data munging and analysis, have made Pandas one of the most popular python packages in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, not all Earth science datasets easily fit into the ‚Äútabular‚Äù model (i.e. rows and columns) imposed by Pandas. In particular, we often deal with multidimensional data. By multidimensional data (also often called N-dimensional), I mean data with many independent dimensions or axes. For example, we might represent Earth‚Äôs surface temperature $T$ as a three dimensional variable\n",

    "A DataArray has four essential attributes:\n",

    "\n",
    "- `dims`: dimension names for each axis (e.g., ('x', 'y', 'z'))\n",
    "\n",
    "- `coords`: a dict-like container of arrays (coordinates) that label each point (e.g., 1-dimensional arrays of numbers, datetime objects or strings)\n",
