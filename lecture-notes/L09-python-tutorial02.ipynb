    "We would like to process meteorological data from Denver's water department using Python. We will first look at the maximum temperature, stores in the file `meteo_denver_tmax_2000_2022.txt`. This file has numbers that are organized in columns and rows and separated by tabs. From the metadata in the README file, we know that there are 23 years of data ranging from 2000 to 2022.\n",

    "To begin processing the meteorological data, we need to load it into Python. We can do that using a library called [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), which stands for Numerical Python. In general, you should use this library when you want to manipulate lots of numbers, especially if you have matrices or arrays. To tell Python that we’d like to start using NumPy, we need to import it:"

This extra information describes `tmax` in the same way an adjective describes a noun. `tmax.shape` is an attribute of `tmax` which describes the dimensions of `tmax`.

    "The expression `tmax[11, 6]` accesses the element at row 11, column 6. While this expression may not surprise you, `tmax[0, 0]` might. Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB and R start counting at 1 because that’s what human beings have done for thousands of years. Languages in the C family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0 because it represents an offset from the first value in the array (the second value is offset by one index from the first value). This is closer to the way that computers represent arrays (if you are interested in the historical reasons behind counting indices from zero, you can read [Mike Hoye’s blog post](http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2013/10/22/citation-needed/)). As a result, if we have an M×N array in Python, its indices go from 0 to M-1 on the first axis and 0 to N-1 on the second. It takes a bit of getting used to, but one way to remember the rule is that the index is how many steps we have to take from the start to get the item we want."

After selecting one, you can also add a question mark (e.g. `numpy.cumprod?`), and IPython will return an explanation of the method! This is the same as doing `help(numpy.cumprod)`. Similarly, if you are using the “plain vanilla” Python interpreter, you can type `numpy.` and press the Tab key twice for a listing of what is available.
