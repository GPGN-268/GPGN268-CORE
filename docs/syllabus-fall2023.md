At the conclusion of the course, you will be able to

- Find, process, visualize, analyze, and interpret multiple flavors of geophysical data;
- Use Unix commands to work with files and directories;
- Identify common geoscience data formats and the best tools to handle them;
- Construct complete, well-structured programs in Python;
- Work in teams to solve geophysical problems and collaborate on projects through GitHub
-   Practice reproducible research through version control, documentation, and metadata aggregation.

### 📆 Course Schedule:
You may find the course schedule [here](https://github.com/GPGN-268/.github/tree/main/profile). Please keep in mind that this is a tentative schedule, and I anticipate changing it as we move through the material – monitor the course GitHub page for current topics and deadlines.

### 📚 Course Material
There is no required text for this course. As we move thorough the semester, course material and external resources will be made available on [GPGN268-CORE](https://github.com/GPGN-268/GPGN268-CORE)

### 💻 Required Technology:
- Laptop (Mac, Linux, or Windows) with at least 6 GB of free disk space. Please come talk to me as soon as possible if you need help finding a laptop that you can use for the course.
- Web-access
- Canvas 
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. I recommend that you sign up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). There are lots of free benefits for students. 

### 📢 Course Communication:
Our main communication channel will be [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/GPGN-268/discussions). There, you will find a private forum that is only available for you, your instructors, and classmates. That is _your_ space for asking questions, discussing with your peers, exchanging resources, and keeping up to date with course announcements. 
- If you have a question, please search for it first on the GitHub discussion board. If you can't find the answer there, I encourage you to post it using the Q&A category – if you feel comfortable doing so.  This allows your peers (who likely have similar questions) to upvote your question, or to provide their own input.

You should not hesitate to seek help, and can do this in the following ways:
1.  Ask questions in class. Never hesitate to ask, even if I have explained the material before. You can safely assume that if something is not clear to you, there are several classmates that have the same question. I can also answer questions related to projects/assignments during class.
2.  Seek the help of the teaching assistant.
3. Drop by my office. On the first day of class, we will decide on a time slot for drop-in office hours. During that time, you are welcome to come by my office without an appointment. Outside of drop-in hours, you may [schedule an appointment with me](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/12dfdf8a370d4da38883619eb1ea9ff0@mines.edu/meetingtype/vVN_CGb6SES1g6k53wy79A2?anonymous).

As an assistant professor at Mines, I have many other responsibilities in addition to teaching. I ask that you be respectful of my time. I only check my email twice a day (I don't mean emails from students, I mean *all* emails). This means that you can expect a one-day response turnaround during the week, but it might take several hours until you hear back from me. I don't check emails on weekends and holidays.

4.  Please only use email to clarify simple questions. I will not provide extensive feedback on assignments or questions about class material through email (but would be happy to arrange a meeting time). If anything is not clear, or if you need help with anything, please ask in a timely way using any of the options above. ⚠️ Please include **GPGN268** in the subject line of any email that you send to me. 

### 🧮 Grading Policy:
My role as a teacher is to support you and provide a nurturing environment that focuses on your learning. Unfortunately, we are still in a system that requires that I assign you grades. Below is what will form the basis of your final grades. The goal is for this to reflect our success in achieving the learning outcomes of this class. 

- **Class Engagement (20%).**  The success of our class will hinge on active engagement from everyone in the classroom. During lectures, discussions, and active learning exercises, this entails coming to class having completed the assigned tasks, being engaged, asking questions, participating in exercises and demonstrations, and promoting class interaction. Outside of the classroom, this entails actively participating in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/GPGN-268/discussions), in the form of questions, comments, answers, and feedback. This is a holistic grade based on your conduct throughout the term. If you are worried or concerned about your class participation, I am happy to provide feedback throughout the semester.

- **Short assignments & quizzes (20%  ).** Throughout the semester you will have short take-home assignments and in-class quizzes. You should complete such assignments individually. 

- **Data stories (30%).** After introducing the fundamentals of scientific computing, we will start to work with several types of geophysical data (around week 8). We will do that through short projects called "Data Stories" and a data analysis report will be due for each one of these projects. Submissions of Data Stories are individual, but you are welcome to discuss and collaborate with your peers on these projects. If you do so, you should explicitly list who participated in the discussion and what was their contribution.

- **Final Project (30%).** The course will culminate with a final group project. The goal of the final project is to assess your ability to work as a team to combine and apply the skills you have learned in class in the context of a real-world geophysics problem. Our class will mostly focus on tools for data analysis and visualization, so this must be the focus of your final project. We will discuss final projects in more detail in the first weeks of class. Each group will be expected to turn in a "Project Milestone"  halfway through the semester, and submit a final project report and give a  presentation to the rest of the class at the end of the term.  

The numeric-to-letter grade scale is shown below:

| **Range** | **Letter Grade** | **Range** | **Letter Grade** |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| >= 93.0   | A                | 73.0–76.9 | C                |
| 90.0–92.9 | A-               | 70.0–72.9 | C-               |
| 87.0–89.9 | B+               | 67.0–66.9 | D+               | 
| 83.0–86.9 | B                | 63.0-66.9 | D                |
| 80.0–82.9 | B-               | 60.0–62.9 | D-               |
| 77.0–79.9 | C+               | <60       | F                |




### ⏰ Late work
There are many items in this class that need to be handed in. In order to keep everything on schedule, I would like you to be sure to hand in assignments on time. If you anticipate difficulty completing an assignment on time, please contact me as early as possible to make arrangements. You will have a grace period of 24h after the due date to submit your work with a 10% penalization.  My goal is that you succeed in this class, so If you're struggling to complete your assignments in time, please come talk to me. 

##  Campus Policies and Resources

**Absences:**
The first commitment to students at Mines is to their academics. Class attendance is required of all students unless the student has an excused absence granted by the school or the student’s professor. An excused absence awarded by the school or professor comes after a student's request or initiative. To review the Excused Absence Policy and/or to request an excused absence, please visit [https://www.mines.edu/student-life/student-absences/](https://www.mines.edu/student-life/student-absences/). 


**Sexual Misconduct, Discrimination, and Retaliation:**

Discrimination, Harassment, and Sexual Misconduct of any type, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking, are prohibited under the Policy Prohibiting Sexual Misconduct, Discrimination, and Retaliation. Please see the [Office for Institutional Equity website](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://www.mines.edu/institutional-equity-title-ix/&data=05%257C01%257Ccartermoulton@mines.edu%257C0b4f3508bffa4646070608db9ab2afaf%257C997209e009b346239a4d76afa44a675c%257C0%257C0%257C638273864471495084%257CUnknown%257CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0=%257C3000%257C%257C%257C&sdata=8tZxEfQw23o78Np2OwF26ttjwbCc/yFpSLN3zsp7ch4=&reserved=0) for information on Sexual Misconduct and Discrimination.

 As your instructor, it is my responsibility to foster a learning environment that supports diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, honors your identities, and is free of discrimination. Please feel free to speak to me if the class is not living up to these standards. Please note that I am also a mandatory reporter as an instructor at Mines, and if I receive a disclosure of Discrimination, Harassment, and/or Sexual Misconduct, I am required to report it to the Title IX Coordinator.

**Preferred First Name Project:**

Mines recognizes members of the campus community may prefer to use a first name other than their legal name to identify themselves. Many services on campus, like Canvas, utilize and display preferred first names. Additional information on preferred name, including how to update your preferred name, is available at the [Office For Institutional Equity website](https://www.mines.edu/institutional-equity-title-ix/preferred-first-name/).

**Academic Integrity:**

Colorado School of Mines affirms the principle that all individuals associated with the Mines academic community have a responsibility for establishing, maintaining, and fostering an understanding and appreciation for academic integrity. In broad terms, this implies protecting the environment of mutual trust within which scholarly exchange occurs, supporting the ability of the faculty to fairly and effectively evaluate every student’s academic achievements, and giving credence to the university’s educational mission, its scholarly objectives, and the substance of the degrees it awards. We desire an environment free of any and all forms of academic misconduct and expects students to act with integrity at all times. Please read the [full academic misconduct/integrity policy](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://www.mines.edu/policy-library/academic-integrity-policy/&data=05%257C01%257Ckcallan@mines.edu%257C46b67f04c769496574f008db89610043%257C997209e009b346239a4d76afa44a675c%257C0%257C0%257C638254821936483524%257CUnknown%257CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0=%257C3000%257C%257C%257C&sdata=SooTXUpiof9XWpaiHTASlzakGTD6QOlsTQ3h+wCcaSM=&reserved=0) for full definitions of academic misconduct.

### 🤖 Generative Artificial Intelligence:

The Office of the Provost encourages the entire University community to explore the uses and impacts of GenAI technologies, whether through critical discussions or creative applications. Based on a review of the most recent [Guidelines for Using Generative Artificial Intelligence at Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu/academic-affairs/genai), the GenAI policy for this course will be *adapted* from the campus **general permission** as follows:

Generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) tools such as ChatGPT are important resources in many fields and industries. Because these tools will be used in professional and personal contexts, I believe it is valuable for you to engage critically with these tools and explore their use in generating content that helps your learning.

You may use genAI tools to help generate ideas and brainstorm. However, you should note that the material generated by these tools may be inaccurate, incomplete, biased, or otherwise problematic. I encourage you to consider how genAI complements, supplants, or fails to replace your contributions and abilities. **I discourage you from submitting material for evaluation that has been generated using genAI.** 

If you include content (e.g., ideas, text, code, images) that was generated, in whole or in part, by Generative Artificial Intelligence tools (including, but not limited to, ChatGPT and other large language models) in work submitted for evaluation in this course, [you must document and credit your source](https://libguides.mines.edu/citing/AI) as well as document the steps used to produce the content (i.e., screenshots of your prompts and chat) Failure to properly cite sources, including AI tools for generating content, would be considered Academic Misconduct in violation of [Mines Academic Integrity/Misconduct Policy](https://www.mines.edu/policy-library/academic-integrity-policy/).

As your instructor, I may request that you walk me through your thought process and explain your answer orally at any time I deem necessary.   

### Diversity and Inclusion:
At Colorado School of Mines, we understand that a diverse and inclusive learning environment inspires creativity and innovation, which are essential to the engineering process. We also know that in order to address current and emerging national and global challenges, it is important to learn with and from people who have different backgrounds, thoughts, and experiences.

Our students represent every state in the nation and more than 90 countries around the world, and we continue to make progress in the areas of diversity and inclusion by providing [Diversity and Inclusion programs and services](https://www.mines.edu/diversity/) to support these efforts.

###  Disability Support Services:
The Colorado School of Mines is committed to ensuring the full participation of all students in its programs, including students with disabilities. If you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning in this course, please feel welcome to discuss your concerns with me. Students with disabilities may also wish to contact Disability Support Services (DSS) to discuss options to removing barriers in this course, including how to register and request official accommodations. Please visit [their website](https://www.mines.edu/disability-support-services/) for contact and additional information, or come talk to me.

### Discrimination, Harassment, and Title IX:
All learning opportunities at Mines, including this course, require an environment that allows each student to be able to learn without fear of discrimination or harassment based on any protected class. Mines's core values of respect, diversity, compassion, and collaboration will be honored in this course, and the standards in this class are the same as those expected in any professional work environment. (More information can be found [here](http://inside.mines.edu/UserFiles/File/FacultySenate/Documents/ValuesAndAspirationsStatement2-14-17.pdf).) Discrimination or harassment of any type will not be tolerated. As a participant in this course, we expect you to respect your instructor and your classmates. As your instructor, it is my responsibility to foster a learning environment that supports diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities.  To help accomplish this:
- Course rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name. I will honor your request to address you by a preferred name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records.
- If something is said or done in this course (by anyone, including myself) that made you or others feel uncomfortable, or if your performance in the course is being impacted by your experiences outside of the course, please report it to:
	- Me (if you are comfortable doing so)  
	- [The Office of Institutional Equity & Title IX](https://www.mines.edu/institutional-equity-title-ix/reporting/)  
	- [The Office of Institutional Equity & Title IX – Anonymous Option](https://www.mines.edu/institutional-equity-title-ix/submit-report/)

In this course, we will cultivate a community that supports survivors, prevents interpersonal violence, and promotes a harassment free environment. Title IX and Colorado State law protects individuals from discrimination based on sex and gender in educational programs and activities. Mines takes this obligation seriously and is committed to providing a campus community free from gender and sex-based discrimination. Discrimination, including sexual harassment, sexual violence, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking, is prohibited and will not be tolerated within the Mines campus community. If these issues have affected you or someone you know, you can access the appropriate resources on the [Mines Title IX website](https://www.mines.edu/title-ix/). You can also contact the Mines Title IX Coordinator, Carole Goddard, at 303.273.3260 or titleix@mines.edu for more information.

**It's on us, all of the Mines community, to engineer a culture of respect.**
